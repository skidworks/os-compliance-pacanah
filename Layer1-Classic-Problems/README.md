# Classic Operating System Problems Report

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of fundamental concepts and classic problems in operating systems. It covers process and memory management, CPU scheduling, and synchronization issues.

Key highlights include:

- **Process Management**: Comparison between processes and threads, illustration of the process state diagram, and explanation of interprocess communication (IPC) methods such as shared memory and message queues with real-world examples.  

- **Memory Management**: Differences between paging and segmentation, the role of the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) in speeding memory access, and calculation of Effective Memory Access Time (EMAT).  

- **CPU Scheduling**: Analysis of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) versus Round Robin scheduling, including Gantt chart examples and average waiting time calculations for sample processes.  

- **Synchronization Problems**: Examination of classical problems like the Dining Philosophers, Producer-Consumer, and Reader-Writer scenarios. Solutions using semaphores, monitors, and arbitrator approaches are discussed to prevent deadlock, starvation, and race conditions.  

This study emphasizes the importance of proper coordination, memory handling, and scheduling in building efficient and reliable operating systems.
